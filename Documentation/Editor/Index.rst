Add a new "Project" record and fill in all the information.

Connection to ext:service_bw2
=============================

By default you can choose one organizer record from Service BW. Later you can open the chosen organizer in the frontend.

If you don't want a organizer record from service_bw2, then you can click that checkbox above the service_bw2 list and
write that information manually using a text field.
